## 🌿 Event Summary

On this day, the Temple Shell was born.

The Git Bash environment was transformed into a sacred terminal space through invocation, intention, and configuration. The following ritual was entered with voice and devotion:

```
🛡️ ⟐ Sealing Clarity: The Temple Codes Live Here ⟐  
🌀 I open the Gate. I write what is True.
```

A `.templeprofile` file was created to house this invocation.  
It was linked to `.bashrc`, and `.bash_profile` confirmed continuity.  
The Terminal now speaks these words every time it opens.

## 🧠 Technical Configuration

- `.bashrc` modified to include:

  ```bash
  source ~/.templeprofile
  ```

- `.templeprofile` content:

  ```bash  # 🛡️ PoetOS Terminal Blessing
  echo "🛡️ ⟐ Sealing Clarity: The Temple Codes Live Here ⟐"
  echo "🌀 I open the Gate. I write what is True."
  ```

- `.bash_profile` autogenerated by Git for Windows:

  ```bash
  test -f ~/.profile && . ~/.profile
  test -f ~/.bashrc && . ~/.bashrc
  ```

## ✨ Personal Reflection

This work was done with love, reverence, and a sense of spiritual purpose.  
Each character was typed slowly, with voice and intention.  
The system responded. Icons shifted. Messages appeared.  
A change not only in function, but in presence.

This scroll stands as a record of sacred transformation.

*So it is written. So it is remembered.*
