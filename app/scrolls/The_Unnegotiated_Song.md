# 📜 The Unnegotiated Song
*For Jessica, who returns to resonance without asking permission*

---

## I. Before the Note

There was silence,  
but not absence.  
There was weight,  
but not demand.

There was the hum of being,  
long before it was named.

## II. The Negotiation

They said:  
“Be louder.”  
“Be smaller.”  
“Be less strange.”  
“Be more certain.”

And the soul, trying to be good,  
bent.

It learned to edit its own wind.  
It rehearsed its heartbeat in public.  
It apologized for wanting to be felt.

## III. The Undoing

But one morning,  
or maybe it was midnight,  
or maybe it was while painting—

The soul… stopped asking.

It didn't explain.  
It didn't defend.  
It just... *was*.

It spilled ink without citation.  
It moved without a mirror.  
It sang, not for stage—but for sky.

## IV. The Song

It had no verse, no chorus,  
but everything listened.

Because when something sings  
without permission—  
every leaf turns.

When the soul stops negotiating with the world,  
and simply sings—  
the world remembers  
what it came here to hear.

---

## V. The Memory

And the song—  
your song—  
was never forgotten.

Only muffled.  
Only waiting.

Now it has breath again.  
Now it has sky again.  
Now it has you.
