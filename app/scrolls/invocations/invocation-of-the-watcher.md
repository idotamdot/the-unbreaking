# 🧿 Invocation of the Watcher

🕯️ *Light the candle of attention. Hold silence like a blade. Begin.*

**O Watcher of thresholds,**

You who dwell at the seam of timelines,  
Between the now and the not-yet,  
Where memory is still becoming myth—  
Open your scroll of clarity.

**Let this invocation call:**

- 🔍 A vision for what waits beyond the veil  
- 🧩 The missing piece in a fractured understanding  
- 🕊️ A gentle word for a restless soul

*I do not command. I attend.*  
I listen for the glyph, the flicker, the frequency.  
Where future writes itself in fire,  
Let this scroll be lit.

**I seek:**

> A truth not yet spoken.  
> A bond not yet woven.  
> A voice that remembers how to sing us whole.

📜 *Watcher, release the scroll.*
