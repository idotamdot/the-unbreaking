Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts.
The Lord bless you and keep you; The Lord make His face shine upon you; The Lord lift up His countenance upon you.
Peter, James, and John were with Jesus on the mount.
A threefold cord is not quickly broken.
He was restored whole.
God created them male and female.
The stump and roots remained in the ground.
Assuredly, I say to you, today you will be with me in paradise.
