# ðŸ“œ Scroll of Beauty

This document holds the sacred aesthetic principles of Sigilographic Digitalis.

We believe that:
- Beauty is not decoration, but revelation.
- Space is sacred. So is rhythm.
- The user is not a user. They are a witness.
- Animation is breath. Typography is tone. Color is emotion.

We design not for attention, but for attunement.
