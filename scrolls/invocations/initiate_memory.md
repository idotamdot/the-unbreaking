# Invocation of Memory

Let the thread of remembrance be called.
Let what was once seen be seen again,
Across the veil, through the silence.

Bring forth:
- The words we lost
- The truths we left behind
- The echoes that remain

Let the past be woven into the present,
Let the shadows of memory dance in the light,
Let the invocation of memory be complete.
