## 🧬 About This Project

**The Unbreaking** is a poetic-technical artifact: part toolkit, part scroll, part ritual UI.  
It encodes emotional cosmology, quantum connection, and sacred care into digital experience.

We honor:
- **Aesthetic interfaces as empathy engines**
- **Apps as covenantal vessels**
- **Code as care**
